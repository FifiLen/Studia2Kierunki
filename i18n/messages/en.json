    "internships": "Internships",
    "documentDeadline": "Can I submit documents after the deadline?",
    "documentDeadlineAnswer": "No, WSH-E gives us a specific time by which we must have your documents prepared. Student ID numbers are also assigned by this time, which are necessary to qualify you for studies. After the deadline, WSH-E does not generate additional ID numbers, which means that applications are not accepted.",
    "shortenCourse": "Can I complete a three-semester course in two semesters?",
    "shortenCourseAnswer": "Yes, provided that you complete the internships scheduled for the third semester during the two semesters.",
    "diplomaCopy": "How can I certify a copy of my diploma as true to the original?",
    "diplomaCopyAnswer": "You can certify it by writing the sentence: \"I confirm this is a true copy of the original\" on the copy and confirming it with your handwritten signature. This form is accepted by WSH-E.",
    "secondCourseDiscount": "Can I get a discount for a second course?",
    "secondCourseDiscountAnswer": "Yes, you can take advantage of the discount by selecting courses from the \"offer\" tab on our website. A 50% discount on the second, cheaper course should be included in the payments.",
    "doctoralDiploma": "Can I send a copy of my doctoral studies diploma?",
    "doctoralDiplomaAnswer": "Unfortunately not, WSH-E only accepts copies of first or second degree diplomas.",
    "shortenTwoSemesters": "Can I complete a two-semester course in one semester?",
    "shortenTwoSemestersAnswer": "Absolutely not, a two-semester course cannot be shortened.",
    "observationSheet": "Who should sign the observation sheet?",
    "observationSheetAnswer": "The intern conducts classes that are observed by the Internship Supervisor who evaluates the intern. Therefore, the internship supervisor signs the document.",
    "observationSheetModule": "To which module should I attach the observation sheet?",
    "observationSheetModuleAnswer": "The observation sheet is attached to the module in which the intern is required to conduct classes independently.",
    "internshipDeadline": "When do I need to submit my internship documents?",

    "completeDocuments": "Why do I need to send all internship documents together?",
    "completeDocumentsAnswer": "Due to the number of students, it is very important that internship documents are sent together in accordance with the \"specialist internship credit\" file. Your documents are sent to WSH-E and checked there for content - the more missing documents, the longer you will wait for your certificate.",
    "documentStatus": "I haven't received a response about whether everything is okay with my internship documents, what does this mean?",
    "documentStatusAnswer": "Most often, this means that WSH-E has checked the documents and has no comments. Comments are sent to students via email. However, it's always worth contacting us in this case to double-check."
